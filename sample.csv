R_74zOYGDUtsHARp3,"We asked for over a year for a bus route from the East Bay that would arrive in time for the employees that begin at 6AM and after doing our own legwork and circulating a petition we finally got a Marguerite shuttle. / Since then it has felt like Stanford is discouraging interest in this shuttle and hoping it will fail.  The shuttle has gotten smaller and smaller and the current shuttle is noisy, uncomfortable, and almost standing room only.  The published pickup time from the East Bay was changed from 5:20 to 5:15 even though the ACTUAL pick-up time is unchanged so now instead of the bus arriving at 5:15 and departing for Stanford at 5:20 the bus now arrives at 5:20 and leaves almost immediately.  Riders are forced to arrive early and wait in the cold or risk missing the bus.

R_3JHRfEyPhXp3hJP,"The wi-fi on the buses is terrible--U, Ardenwood Express and DBs (the U is the best of the lot).  Yesterday i forgot my phone and needed to call my husband on the way home so i wanted to Skype him with my iPad, but the AE had no wi-fi.  At Ardenwood Park and Ride i was able to connect to him briefly while standing next to a DB going back to Stanford.  When the DB and DB1 arrived simultaneously to go to Union City Bart i ran from one to the other and neither had working wi-fi!  One showed that it was connected but it didn't work.  I finallly had to call him from a pay phone at BART.  But it's typical that one or more of the multiple buses i take to or from campus has wifi that doesn't work, and sometimes it's all of them.  And with the diddling with the bus schedules over the years and increasing traffic, my commute is about 15 minutes longer in the morning and a half an hour or more longer in the afternoon, often exceeding 2 hours.

R_4IV6a7F0c6W1HzT,"Caltrain is great however parking is starting to become an issue. At the San Carlos station there used to be plentiful street parking but due to construction/development street parking close to the station is getting more difficult.

I'll probably park further away and bike to the station however due to scheduling (dropping off my son at school) there are still time limitations with regards to how much earlier I can get to the station. I believe Stanford used to offer pretax Caltrain parking passes. I would say depending on how bad street parking gets and taking into consideration the cost of a Caltrain parking pass, that driving into work might become a reality. My second comment is that there seems to be some inconsistency in when the Palm Drive departs the station in the morning. Some drivers wait for passengers while some pull away from the stop even with passengers close-by and clearly in view. From what I understand the P leaves on the tens. If this schedule is stuck to then that's fine however many times I've arrived on a train that pulls in at 8:23 (or somewhere in between the tens) and the P is still at the stop (I take a peek when the train is pulling in to see if the P is at the stop so I know if I should run), then only after passengers depart and we are walking toward the P does the driver leave (well past 8:20 and too early for the 8:30 departure).

I hope that there will soon be more parking on the Med School side of things so that Parking Structure 1 will not be so over-used.   (2)  Also about parking:  in our structure, there is no way to tell whether the upper levels are full.  If I have to drive at mid-day and can't use carpool spots (or if these are already gone, see comment (1)), I waste time and gas trying to drive to the upper levels only to find that there are no spots available.   Dozens of other cars will be circulating, producing exhaust and using gasoline, all trying to find a spot.

I find myself MISSING activities with my kids from time to time because I know that I will be unable to find parking.  I won't help out in their classrooms in the morning b/c I won't be able to park.  The early-rising hospital employees get most of the parking spots!  Perhaps we need to create more classes of permits so faculty can park.  Or, perhaps Stanford needs to make rules that students (undergrads and grad students) are not allowed to buy A permits.

I have an child care but after the route change, I would be regularly late and would be charged additional for child care. I think it's impractical to use transit if you live 15 - 20 mins away by car but it takes you upwards of an hour (many time hour and half) to get home. Therefore, I had to switch to driving again.

Talking about parking permits or gas prices as disincentives to driving wholly misinterprets the reason(s) people drive to work - nobody commutes for fun; they do it because they have to. Really, what Stanford should be doing is leveraging its position as a well-funded and well-respected institution to initiate public transit projects up and down the peninsula, because they are vastly under-resourced and more and more people are expressing a preference NOT to drive (and to live in urban areas).

R_3juOmCHr6oou4eN,"I used to take Caltrain from San Francisco and then Margeurite to campus. I now work off campus at 1070 Arastradero, and no longer take public transportation because the margeurite shuttle that runs between Caltrain and 1070 does not run as frequently - so if the train is late then I wait for another 30 minutes for the next shuttle to come.  Also because the shuttle makes more stops along this route it takes ~30 minutes.  So the trade off is to build in an extra 2 hrs round trip to my commute each day -- which isn't worth it for me. So it tends to be much faster and more consistent for me to drive each way. / If there were a dedicated 1070/1050 arastradero shuttle that picked up from Caltrain after each train I would use it! : ) / I miss taking the train! : (",10/14/13,,Marguerite,,,,,,,,,

For my commute, I usually drive alone mainly because of my child's transportation, but sometimes take VTA (or walk) - Caltrain - Marguerite (or walk). Each ride is very short, but using three different modules in one commute takes 2-3 times as long as driving because these transits don't have enough services and the connection is very inconvenient. I am a big fan of public transportation, so if these transit companies provide more services in commuting hours, and coordinate each other to provide more passenger-friendly connection and schedules, I would definitely use them more often. Also, I wish that the University would encourage telecommute more. A lot of work could be done at home as long as we have a computer and internet access.

More weekend service would also be appreciated (there's really no way of getting from many parts of campus to the Caltrain station, except the Shopping Express which takes time and comes infrequently). /  / There also needs to be a lot more bicycle parking on campus - most buildings have a few spots around them, but not enough to cover the rated capacity of the building. As a result, people have to park far from their classes or work. Many elect instead to leave their bikes locked only to themselves, often resulting in a mass of bikes in front of doors, creating a safety hazard. Others choose to lock their bikes to railings for safety, resulting in warnings or citations. Since this problem arises from lack of bicycle parking, I would strongly urge P&TS to install more bicycle racks near buildings (including considering bike lockers, hanging racks, and multi-storey racks, like those found at the shopping center, to increase bicycle parking density. There appears to be a lot of thought given to car parking, presumably mostly due to county regulations, but not all that much thought given to bike parking, despite Stanford saying how bike-friendly this campus is.",10/14/13,Bike,Marguerite,,,Parking,,,,,,

R_djnuDjTUvPlJs21,"I usually bike, walk, or take the Marguerite to campus. Every once in a while, when I know I will have to stay on campus very late to use a shared research tool or for some other reason, I stay at my home until around 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM and then drive my car to campus and park in visitor parking or C parking using a scratch permit. It makes me feel safer to drive home at 1:00 AM than it does to walk or bike at this time, especially given that there have been some robberies on Palm Drive and elsewhere on campus. However, it is usually extraordinarily difficult to park on campus during this time. I understand that it is good to minimize driving to campus as much as possible, but in certain situations like this I feel that driving is the best option for my personal safety. I think it would be helpful to consider strategies for making it easier to park on campus in these situations. For example, consider demand responsive pricing at the visitor pay parking stations (i.e. increase/decrease prices throughout the day so there is always on average one spot free at all times). Better yet, it seems that there are usually some parking spaces free on the top floor of Parking Structure 1 near my building, but these are A permit spaces. Maybe some of these spaces should be converted to additional visitor pay parking or C permit spaces. Having any unused parking spaces seems like a tremendous waste. Sometimes I have to drive around for up to 20 minutes to find a parking space, which is bad for the environment, bad for traffic on campus, and a waste of my time.",10/14/13,,,,,Parking,,,,,,

R_6KehrhEH2MVLxQ1,"1) Graduate students should be eligible for Go Pass.  This would increase public transportation usage while financially assisting a more needy Stanford group.  Grad students make roughly $25,000/year through stipend support, and yet are not eligible for a subsidized Go Pass; employees make considerably more, but are eligible.  There needs to be better support for graduate student commuters.  Bike maintenance programs, commute club, clean air cash, updates from P&TS are not significant; real support should come in dollars spent on subsidizing actual commute passes for those that need it.  Otherwise, why not just drive if you can? /  / 3) The Commute Cash ordering system is very confusing.  Commuters do not remember when they ordered, what months the listed on their order, when they need to re-order, etc..  This process could be streamlined and simplified.  Why not use that money to subsidize public transit like the Go Pass for more members of the Stanford community and then eliminate the confusion of the commute cash? /  / 2) Better timed Marguerite shuttles for Caltrain connection.  It would not be hard to adjust the X, Y, and P Marguerite lines so that the depart Palo Alto Caltrain station after Caltrains arrive rather that just minutes before.  It is extremely frustrating when connections do not match because a train is merely 2 minutes late, or when there is no shuttle scheduled to depart for 20+ minutes.  Since Bay Area transit is so fragmented among so many different systems (BART, Caltrain, VTA, MUNI, etc. etc.), any help in making connections easier would greatly benefit commuters.

R_9GNqgVSOWZy9ZLD,"I appreciate these surveys, but they aren't geared toward 'mega-commuters.' I travel about 180 miles (30 - 40 hours per week) round trip and luckily I can commute with people to Cupertino most days, but that will change in 2015. I think individual departments should distribute and respond to this survey to counsel employees who may have complicated commutes directly. This is about the third survey I've taken and I don't hear the survey results and never seem to be notified if any changes are implemented as a result of respondent feedback. I also don't think carpool credit applies since I split from my carpool partners (my kids going to DeAnza college) and they park on their campus. I might be going back to commuter club since it's cheaper for them to park on their campus than it is for me. Also the gas credit doesn't work because I travel so far. I stopped uploading my receipts because one trip uses them up and it's not worth trying to remember when I can upload a new gas receipt when I fill up 2-3 times per week depending if I'm working on Saturday. I hope you don't see this as complaining, I just want to be sure that you have feedback beyond the information you are looking to gather.

R_5mDgpiLISbBEEux,"I am very dissatisfied with the parking on campus. It is very expensive, even for residents who have families. I understand that if you're singly you might not need a car. But if you have a family with young kids, not having a car is not really an option since it's impractical to carry car seats to the zip cars every time you want to use them. Furthermore, not only are we charged a lot to park (and ticketed if we or our friends don't use the passes), during the busiest times the parking lots remain unenforced. For example, during football games, spectators park in our lots and make it very hard for us to find a spot. Additionally, there was recently an event at a Parent Coop (the one by Stanford Credit Union just off of Serra), where resident parking was explicitly given to the event. There were literally dozens of cars circling around my street and I couldn't go to the store because there wouldn't have been any spots when I got back. I don't understand why I pay for my parking spot, but then other organizations are explicitly given access to my parking spot (for free) when it's convenient for them. If I pay for a spot there better be a spot for me to park. I would understand a little more if we even got a few free scratchers for our friends. But I have no clue why a Stanford event should be allowed to take my parking space for free when my friends or I would get a ticket for doing the same thing.  / I love Stanford, but I don't like the parking and transportation services. We are treated like garbage and then we get these emails asking us for favors (such as not leaving or coming to campus during peak hours). Why would I care if Stanford is charged money by the city (for excessive peak hour traffic) if they're charging me tons of money for services that they are giving away to others for free? I even got a traffic ticket this year, which lost on appeal, when I had paid for my permit! I had not yet received it, but I did have the approved receipt in the window (which according to the receipt was a valid method of parking there). Stanford parking and transportation services treats me like garbage and I (and most other people I know) will make no effort to reduce traffic or make your jobs easier until you stop either not charging us for parking or at the very least not give the parking that we paid for away for free.

R_0dHwnyzzT3rrb1j,Overall the Uline service has improved over the past year. There is still a disconnect between a missing U line bus and this being communicated to riders.  This is especially impactful when it is the last bus of the day that is a no show because I have to have my husband come out and pick me up. I feel that Uline should be required to report all disabled buses to Stanford and there should be automatic Marguerite shuttle available when the uline is disabled. The Uline buses are getting old and starting to break down more. There was also a new Uline bus recently that has the minimal seating and a lot of standing that I would consider a great disservice if half of the buss had to stand all of the time.  Also the cross walk on Fremont Blvd on the East bound route is dangerous. It is not at a typical intersection and so people don't pay attention to people crossing the street. It would be helpful if Stanford could engage Fremont to put flashing lights across the cross walk to bring attention to the pedestrian traffic there.

R_6PwChhJTfpuQtGR,"Driving commutes have gotten dramatically worse in the 18 months I have been at Stanford, likely due at least in part to increased employment in the region. I try to do public transit at least one day per week (BART to Caltrain), but it takes 2 hours or more each way, and I often can't even get work done because of the need to stand on the train. Carpools and vanpools are too inflexible because I often have work situations that don't allow me to leave work at a regular time each day. What I REALLY would find useful is an express bus (like the Ardenwood Express) from the upper East Bay (I am in Alameda) that perhaps went twice a day in each direction - an early option and a late option. I could get work done on a large bus, and I would be able to get a later bus if I missed the early one. Please investigate the large number of Stanford people who I believe are commuting from the upper East Bay - Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, Albany. I have met dozens of them just in my own travels around campus. With the cost of housing in the Silicon Valley so prohibitive and no housing assistance programs available to staff, it really is necessary to have some transit alternatives that go beyond BART to Dumbarton Express/Line U/Caltrain, given the large amount of time those routes require.

I live 3 miles away from my work station on the main campus, but because there are no efficient transit routes between home and work, I am driving alone more often. The mismatch in times between Marguerite's arrival at Caltrain and Caltrain's departure, and the fact that I can only take trains that stop at every stop since I live by the next stop (Menlo Park), combine to make what should be a short commute much more lengthy.

The Margarite runs on week days with non-student friendly hours. I cannot use the Margarite to get home after 9 pm.  Because I run hours twice a week until 10 pm, the Margarite is often unhelpful.

It takes me 20 minutes to walk from the nearest Marguerite stop I can find on campus to get to my work place at IRISS (which is by the gold course). This is good when there is time but it's a shame that there is no closer stop. Bus stop numbers may make it a bit easier for people new to campus to understand the routes. As a visiting scholar who is staying about 30 minutes away I have found that this is all pretty complex and there is no quick learning curve. The Caltrain service at San Antonio is surprisingly restricted - there are surprisingly few suitable trains outside rush hour given that there is such a large population! The Marguerite buses to/from San Antonio area are not at suitable times for commuting to campus. It has been very hard for me to find a second hand bike that suits my height (tall woman - I have so far looked at four that are too small) and the bike shop on campus was unable serve me when I walked there at lunchtime (a 30 minute round trip) owing to a queue of people wanting repairs. My most remarkable experience was when I went to the Palo Alta bike shop and asked to be measured for a bike - they told me it would cost $350 to sit on their measuring machine.

R_74zOYGDUtsHARp3,"We asked for over a year for a bus route from the East Bay that would arrive in time for the employees that begin at 6AM and after doing our own legwork and circulating a petition we finally got a Marguerite shuttle. / Since then it has felt like Stanford is discouraging interest in this shuttle and hoping it will fail.  The shuttle has gotten smaller and smaller and the current shuttle is noisy, uncomfortable, and almost standing room only.  The published pickup time from the East Bay was changed from 5:20 to 5:15 even though the ACTUAL pick-up time is unchanged so now instead of the bus arriving at 5:15 and departing for Stanford at 5:20 the bus now arrives at 5:20 and leaves almost immediately.

Yesterday i forgot my phone and needed to call my husband on the way home so i wanted to Skype him with my iPad, but the AE had no wi-fi.  At Ardenwood Park and Ride i was able to connect to him briefly while standing next to a DB going back to Stanford.  When the DB and DB1 arrived simultaneously to go to Union City Bart i ran from one to the other and neither had working wi-fi!  One showed that it was connected but it didn't work.  I finallly had to call him from a pay phone at BART.  But it's typical that one or more of the multiple buses i take to or from campus has wifi that doesn't work, and sometimes it's all of them.  And with the diddling with the bus schedules over the years and increasing traffic, my commute is about 15 minutes longer in the morning and a half an hour or more longer in the afternoon, often exceeding 2 hours.

R_4IV6a7F0c6W1HzT,"Caltrain is great however parking is starting to become an issue. At the San Carlos station there used to be plentiful street parking but due to construction/development street parking close to the station is getting more difficult.

I'll probably park further away and bike to the station however due to scheduling (dropping off my son at school) there are still time limitations with regards to how much earlier I can get to the station. I believe Stanford used to offer pretax Caltrain parking passes. I would say depending on how bad street parking gets and taking into consideration the cost of a Caltrain parking pass, that driving into work might become a reality. My second comment is that there seems to be some inconsistency in when the Palm Drive departs the station in the morning. Some drivers wait for passengers while some pull away from the stop even with passengers close-by and clearly in view. From what I understand the P leaves on the tens. If this schedule is stuck to then that's fine however many times I've arrived on a train that pulls in at 8:23 (or somewhere in between the tens) and the P is still at the stop (I take a peek when the train is pulling in to see if the P is at the stop so I know if I should run), then only after passengers depart and we are walking toward the P does the driver leave (well past 8:20 and too early for the 8:30 departure).

I hope that there will soon be more parking on the Med School side of things so that Parking Structure 1 will not be so over-used.   (2)  Also about parking:  in our structure, there is no way to tell whether the upper levels are full.  If I have to drive at mid-day and can't use carpool spots (or if these are already gone, see comment (1)), I waste time and gas trying to drive to the upper levels only to find that there are no spots available.   Dozens of other cars will be circulating, producing exhaust and using gasoline, all trying to find a spot.

I won't help out in their classrooms in the morning b/c I won't be able to park.  The early-rising hospital employees get most of the parking spots!

Plus, I would drive to the Embarcadero site, then get on the TECH line, get off and Caltrain, and then get on the X line and repeat the whole process again in the evening.  I have an child care but after the route change, I would be regularly late and would be charged additional for child care. I think it's impractical to use transit if you live 15 - 20 mins away by car but it takes you upwards of an hour (many time hour and half) to get home. Therefore, I had to switch to driving again.

Talking about parking permits or gas prices as disincentives to driving wholly misinterprets the reason(s) people drive to work - nobody commutes for fun; they do it because they have to. Really, what Stanford should be doing is leveraging its position as a well-funded and well-respected institution to initiate public transit projects up and down the peninsula, because they are vastly under-resourced and more and more people are expressing a preference NOT to drive (and to live in urban areas).

R_3juOmCHr6oou4eN,"I used to take Caltrain from San Francisco and then Margeurite to campus. I now work off campus at 1070 Arastradero, and no longer take public transportation because the margeurite shuttle that runs between Caltrain and 1070 does not run as frequently - so if the train is late then I wait for another 30 minutes for the next shuttle to come.  Also because the shuttle makes more stops along this route it takes ~30 minutes.  So the trade off is to build in an extra 2 hrs round trip to my commute each day -- which isn't worth it for me. So it tends to be much faster and more consistent for me to drive each way. / If there were a dedicated 1070/1050 arastradero shuttle that picked up from Caltrain after each train I would use it! : ) / I miss taking the train! : (",10/14/13,,Marguerite,,,,,,,,,

For my commute, I usually drive alone mainly because of my child's transportation, but sometimes take VTA (or walk) - Caltrain - Marguerite (or walk). Each ride is very short, but using three different modules in one commute takes 2-3 times as long as driving because these transits don't have enough services and the connection is very inconvenient. I am a big fan of public transportation, so if these transit companies provide more services in commuting hours, and coordinate each other to provide more passenger-friendly connection and schedules, I would definitely use them more often. Also, I wish that the University would encourage telecommute more. A lot of work could be done at home as long as we have a computer and internet access.

More weekend service would also be appreciated (there's really no way of getting from many parts of campus to the Caltrain station, except the Shopping Express which takes time and comes infrequently). /  / There also needs to be a lot more bicycle parking on campus - most buildings have a few spots around them, but not enough to cover the rated capacity of the building. As a result, people have to park far from their classes or work. Many elect instead to leave their bikes locked only to themselves, often resulting in a mass of bikes in front of doors, creating a safety hazard. Others choose to lock their bikes to railings for safety, resulting in warnings or citations. Since this problem arises from lack of bicycle parking, I would strongly urge P&TS to install more bicycle racks near buildings (including considering bike lockers, hanging racks, and multi-storey racks, like those found at the shopping center, to increase bicycle parking density. There appears to be a lot of thought given to car parking, presumably mostly due to county regulations, but not all that much thought given to bike parking, despite Stanford saying how bike-friendly this campus is.",10/14/13,Bike,Marguerite,,,Parking,,,,,,

R_djnuDjTUvPlJs21,"I usually bike, walk, or take the Marguerite to campus. Every once in a while, when I know I will have to stay on campus very late to use a shared research tool or for some other reason, I stay at my home until around 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM and then drive my car to campus and park in visitor parking or C parking using a scratch permit. It makes me feel safer to drive home at 1:00 AM than it does to walk or bike at this time, especially given that there have been some robberies on Palm Drive and elsewhere on campus. However, it is usually extraordinarily difficult to park on campus during this time. I understand that it is good to minimize driving to campus as much as possible, but in certain situations like this I feel that driving is the best option for my personal safety. I think it would be helpful to consider strategies for making it easier to park on campus in these situations. For example, consider demand responsive pricing at the visitor pay parking stations (i.e. increase/decrease prices throughout the day so there is always on average one spot free at all times). Better yet, it seems that there are usually some parking spaces free on the top floor of Parking Structure 1 near my building, but these are A permit spaces. Maybe some of these spaces should be converted to additional visitor pay parking or C permit spaces. Having any unused parking spaces seems like a tremendous waste. Sometimes I have to drive around for up to 20 minutes to find a parking space, which is bad for the environment, bad for traffic on campus, and a waste of my time.",10/14/13,,,,,Parking,,,,,,

R_6KehrhEH2MVLxQ1,"1) Graduate students should be eligible for Go Pass.  This would increase public transportation usage while financially assisting a more needy Stanford group.  Grad students make roughly $25,000/year through stipend support, and yet are not eligible for a subsidized Go Pass; employees make considerably more, but are eligible.  There needs to be better support for graduate student commuters.  Bike maintenance programs, commute club, clean air cash, updates from P&TS are not significant; real support should come in dollars spent on subsidizing actual commute passes for those that need it.  Otherwise, why not just drive if you can? /  / 3) The Commute Cash ordering system is very confusing.  Commuters do not remember when they ordered, what months the listed on their order, when they need to re-order, etc..  This process could be streamlined and simplified.  Why not use that money to subsidize public transit like the Go Pass for more members of the Stanford community and then eliminate the confusion of the commute cash? /  / 2) Better timed Marguerite shuttles for Caltrain connection.  It would not be hard to adjust the X, Y, and P Marguerite lines so that the depart Palo Alto Caltrain station after Caltrains arrive rather that just minutes before.  It is extremely frustrating when connections do not match because a train is merely 2 minutes late, or when there is no shuttle scheduled to depart for 20+ minutes.  Since Bay Area transit is so fragmented among so many different systems (BART, Caltrain, VTA, MUNI, etc. etc.), any help in making connections easier would greatly benefit commuters.

R_9GNqgVSOWZy9ZLD,"I appreciate these surveys, but they aren't geared toward 'mega-commuters.' I travel about 180 miles (30 - 40 hours per week) round trip and luckily I can commute with people to Cupertino most days, but that will change in 2015. I think individual departments should distribute and respond to this survey to counsel employees who may have complicated commutes directly. This is about the third survey I've taken and I don't hear the survey results and never seem to be notified if any changes are implemented as a result of respondent feedback. I also don't think carpool credit applies since I split from my carpool partners (my kids going to DeAnza college) and they park on their campus. I might be going back to commuter club since it's cheaper for them to park on their campus than it is for me. Also the gas credit doesn't work because I travel so far. I stopped uploading my receipts because one trip uses them up and it's not worth trying to remember when I can upload a new gas receipt when I fill up 2-3 times per week depending if I'm working on Saturday. I hope you don't see this as complaining, I just want to be sure that you have feedback beyond the information you are looking to gather.

R_5mDgpiLISbBEEux,"I am very dissatisfied with the parking on campus. It is very expensive, even for residents who have families. I understand that if you're singly you might not need a car. But if you have a family with young kids, not having a car is not really an option since it's impractical to carry car seats to the zip cars every time you want to use them. Furthermore, not only are we charged a lot to park (and ticketed if we or our friends don't use the passes), during the busiest times the parking lots remain unenforced. For example, during football games, spectators park in our lots and make it very hard for us to find a spot. Additionally, there was recently an event at a Parent Coop (the one by Stanford Credit Union just off of Serra), where resident parking was explicitly given to the event. There were literally dozens of cars circling around my street and I couldn't go to the store because there wouldn't have been any spots when I got back. I don't understand why I pay for my parking spot, but then other organizations are explicitly given access to my parking spot (for free) when it's convenient for them. If I pay for a spot there better be a spot for me to park. I would understand a little more if we even got a few free scratchers for our friends. But I have no clue why a Stanford event should be allowed to take my parking space for free when my friends or I would get a ticket for doing the same thing.  / I love Stanford, but I don't like the parking and transportation services. We are treated like garbage and then we get these emails asking us for favors (such as not leaving or coming to campus during peak hours). Why would I care if Stanford is charged money by the city (for excessive peak hour traffic) if they're charging me tons of money for services that they are giving away to others for free? I even got a traffic ticket this year, which lost on appeal, when I had paid for my permit! I had not yet received it, but I did have the approved receipt in the window (which according to the receipt was a valid method of parking there). Stanford parking and transportation services treats me like garbage and I (and most other people I know) will make no effort to reduce traffic or make your jobs easier until you stop either not charging us for parking or at the very least not give the parking that we paid for away for free.

R_0dHwnyzzT3rrb1j,Overall the Uline service has improved over the past year. There is still a disconnect between a missing U line bus and this being communicated to riders.  This is especially impactful when it is the last bus of the day that is a no show because I have to have my husband come out and pick me up. I feel that Uline should be required to report all disabled buses to Stanford and there should be automatic Marguerite shuttle available when the uline is disabled. The Uline buses are getting old and starting to break down more. There was also a new Uline bus recently that has the minimal seating and a lot of standing that I would consider a great disservice if half of the buss had to stand all of the time.  Also the cross walk on Fremont Blvd on the East bound route is dangerous. It is not at a typical intersection and so people don't pay attention to people crossing the street. It would be helpful if Stanford could engage Fremont to put flashing lights across the cross walk to bring attention to the pedestrian traffic there.

R_6PwChhJTfpuQtGR,"Driving commutes have gotten dramatically worse in the 18 months I have been at Stanford, likely due at least in part to increased employment in the region. I try to do public transit at least one day per week (BART to Caltrain), but it takes 2 hours or more each way, and I often can't even get work done because of the need to stand on the train. Carpools and vanpools are too inflexible because I often have work situations that don't allow me to leave work at a regular time each day. What I REALLY would find useful is an express bus (like the Ardenwood Express) from the upper East Bay (I am in Alameda) that perhaps went twice a day in each direction - an early option and a late option. I could get work done on a large bus, and I would be able to get a later bus if I missed the early one. Please investigate the large number of Stanford people who I believe are commuting from the upper East Bay - Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, Albany. I have met dozens of them just in my own travels around campus. With the cost of housing in the Silicon Valley so prohibitive and no housing assistance programs available to staff, it really is necessary to have some transit alternatives that go beyond BART to Dumbarton Express/Line U/Caltrain, given the large amount of time those routes require.

I live 3 miles away from my work station on the main campus, but because there are no efficient transit routes between home and work, I am driving alone more often. The mismatch in times between Marguerite's arrival at Caltrain and Caltrain's departure, and the fact that I can only take trains that stop at every stop since I live by the next stop (Menlo Park), combine to make what should be a short commute much more lengthy.

The Margarite runs on week days with non-student friendly hours. I cannot use the Margarite to get home after 9 pm.  Because I run hours twice a week until 10 pm, the Margarite is often unhelpful.

It takes me 20 minutes to walk from the nearest Marguerite stop I can find on campus to get to my work place at IRISS (which is by the gold course). This is good when there is time but it's a shame that there is no closer stop. Bus stop numbers may make it a bit easier for people new to campus to understand the routes. As a visiting scholar who is staying about 30 minutes away I have found that this is all pretty complex and there is no quick learning curve. The Caltrain service at San Antonio is surprisingly restricted - there are surprisingly few suitable trains outside rush hour given that there is such a large population! The Marguerite buses to/from San Antonio area are not at suitable times for commuting to campus. It has been very hard for me to find a second hand bike that suits my height (tall woman - I have so far looked at four that are too small) and the bike shop on campus was unable serve me when I walked there at lunchtime (a 30 minute round trip) owing to a queue of people wanting repairs. My most remarkable experience was when I went to the Palo Alta bike shop and asked to be measured for a bike - they told me it would cost $350 to sit on their measuring machine.

R_74zOYGDUtsHARp3,"We asked for over a year for a bus route from the East Bay that would arrive in time for the employees that begin at 6AM and after doing our own legwork and circulating a petition we finally got a Marguerite shuttle. / Since then it has felt like Stanford is discouraging interest in this shuttle and hoping it will fail.  The shuttle has gotten smaller and smaller and the current shuttle is noisy, uncomfortable, and almost standing room only.  The published pickup time from the East Bay was changed from 5:20 to 5:15 even though the ACTUAL pick-up time is unchanged so now instead of the bus arriving at 5:15 and departing for Stanford at 5:20 the bus now arrives at 5:20 and leaves almost immediately.

Yesterday i forgot my phone and needed to call my husband on the way home so i wanted to Skype him with my iPad, but the AE had no wi-fi.  At Ardenwood Park and Ride i was able to connect to him briefly while standing next to a DB going back to Stanford.  When the DB and DB1 arrived simultaneously to go to Union City Bart i ran from one to the other and neither had working wi-fi!  One showed that it was connected but it didn't work.  I finallly had to call him from a pay phone at BART.  But it's typical that one or more of the multiple buses i take to or from campus has wifi that doesn't work, and sometimes it's all of them.  And with the diddling with the bus schedules over the years and increasing traffic, my commute is about 15 minutes longer in the morning and a half an hour or more longer in the afternoon, often exceeding 2 hours.

R_4IV6a7F0c6W1HzT,"Caltrain is great however parking is starting to become an issue. At the San Carlos station there used to be plentiful street parking but due to construction/development street parking close to the station is getting more difficult.

I'll probably park further away and bike to the station however due to scheduling (dropping off my son at school) there are still time limitations with regards to how much earlier I can get to the station. I believe Stanford used to offer pretax Caltrain parking passes. I would say depending on how bad street parking gets and taking into consideration the cost of a Caltrain parking pass, that driving into work might become a reality. My second comment is that there seems to be some inconsistency in when the Palm Drive departs the station in the morning. Some drivers wait for passengers while some pull away from the stop even with passengers close-by and clearly in view. From what I understand the P leaves on the tens. If this schedule is stuck to then that's fine however many times I've arrived on a train that pulls in at 8:23 (or somewhere in between the tens) and the P is still at the stop (I take a peek when the train is pulling in to see if the P is at the stop so I know if I should run), then only after passengers depart and we are walking toward the P does the driver leave (well past 8:20 and too early for the 8:30 departure).

I hope that there will soon be more parking on the Med School side of things so that Parking Structure 1 will not be so over-used.   (2)  Also about parking:  in our structure, there is no way to tell whether the upper levels are full.  If I have to drive at mid-day and can't use carpool spots (or if these are already gone, see comment (1)), I waste time and gas trying to drive to the upper levels only to find that there are no spots available.   Dozens of other cars will be circulating, producing exhaust and using gasoline, all trying to find a spot.

I won't help out in their classrooms in the morning b/c I won't be able to park.  The early-rising hospital employees get most of the parking spots!

Plus, I would drive to the Embarcadero site, then get on the TECH line, get off and Caltrain, and then get on the X line and repeat the whole process again in the evening.  I have an child care but after the route change, I would be regularly late and would be charged additional for child care. I think it's impractical to use transit if you live 15 - 20 mins away by car but it takes you upwards of an hour (many time hour and half) to get home. Therefore, I had to switch to driving again.

Talking about parking permits or gas prices as disincentives to driving wholly misinterprets the reason(s) people drive to work - nobody commutes for fun; they do it because they have to. Really, what Stanford should be doing is leveraging its position as a well-funded and well-respected institution to initiate public transit projects up and down the peninsula, because they are vastly under-resourced and more and more people are expressing a preference NOT to drive (and to live in urban areas).

R_3juOmCHr6oou4eN,"I used to take Caltrain from San Francisco and then Margeurite to campus. I now work off campus at 1070 Arastradero, and no longer take public transportation because the margeurite shuttle that runs between Caltrain and 1070 does not run as frequently - so if the train is late then I wait for another 30 minutes for the next shuttle to come.  Also because the shuttle makes more stops along this route it takes ~30 minutes.  So the trade off is to build in an extra 2 hrs round trip to my commute each day -- which isn't worth it for me. So it tends to be much faster and more consistent for me to drive each way. / If there were a dedicated 1070/1050 arastradero shuttle that picked up from Caltrain after each train I would use it! : ) / I miss taking the train! : (",10/14/13,,Marguerite,,,,,,,,,

For my commute, I usually drive alone mainly because of my child's transportation, but sometimes take VTA (or walk) - Caltrain - Marguerite (or walk). Each ride is very short, but using three different modules in one commute takes 2-3 times as long as driving because these transits don't have enough services and the connection is very inconvenient. I am a big fan of public transportation, so if these transit companies provide more services in commuting hours, and coordinate each other to provide more passenger-friendly connection and schedules, I would definitely use them more often. Also, I wish that the University would encourage telecommute more. A lot of work could be done at home as long as we have a computer and internet access.

More weekend service would also be appreciated (there's really no way of getting from many parts of campus to the Caltrain station, except the Shopping Express which takes time and comes infrequently). /  / There also needs to be a lot more bicycle parking on campus - most buildings have a few spots around them, but not enough to cover the rated capacity of the building. As a result, people have to park far from their classes or work. Many elect instead to leave their bikes locked only to themselves, often resulting in a mass of bikes in front of doors, creating a safety hazard. Others choose to lock their bikes to railings for safety, resulting in warnings or citations. Since this problem arises from lack of bicycle parking, I would strongly urge P&TS to install more bicycle racks near buildings (including considering bike lockers, hanging racks, and multi-storey racks, like those found at the shopping center, to increase bicycle parking density. There appears to be a lot of thought given to car parking, presumably mostly due to county regulations, but not all that much thought given to bike parking, despite Stanford saying how bike-friendly this campus is.",10/14/13,Bike,Marguerite,,,Parking,,,,,,

R_djnuDjTUvPlJs21,"I usually bike, walk, or take the Marguerite to campus. Every once in a while, when I know I will have to stay on campus very late to use a shared research tool or for some other reason, I stay at my home until around 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM and then drive my car to campus and park in visitor parking or C parking using a scratch permit. It makes me feel safer to drive home at 1:00 AM than it does to walk or bike at this time, especially given that there have been some robberies on Palm Drive and elsewhere on campus. However, it is usually extraordinarily difficult to park on campus during this time. I understand that it is good to minimize driving to campus as much as possible, but in certain situations like this I feel that driving is the best option for my personal safety. I think it would be helpful to consider strategies for making it easier to park on campus in these situations. For example, consider demand responsive pricing at the visitor pay parking stations (i.e. increase/decrease prices throughout the day so there is always on average one spot free at all times). Better yet, it seems that there are usually some parking spaces free on the top floor of Parking Structure 1 near my building, but these are A permit spaces. Maybe some of these spaces should be converted to additional visitor pay parking or C permit spaces. Having any unused parking spaces seems like a tremendous waste. Sometimes I have to drive around for up to 20 minutes to find a parking space, which is bad for the environment, bad for traffic on campus, and a waste of my time.",10/14/13,,,,,Parking,,,,,,

R_6KehrhEH2MVLxQ1,"1) Graduate students should be eligible for Go Pass.  This would increase public transportation usage while financially assisting a more needy Stanford group.  Grad students make roughly $25,000/year through stipend support, and yet are not eligible for a subsidized Go Pass; employees make considerably more, but are eligible.  There needs to be better support for graduate student commuters.  Bike maintenance programs, commute club, clean air cash, updates from P&TS are not significant; real support should come in dollars spent on subsidizing actual commute passes for those that need it.  Otherwise, why not just drive if you can? /  / 3) The Commute Cash ordering system is very confusing.  Commuters do not remember when they ordered, what months the listed on their order, when they need to re-order, etc..  This process could be streamlined and simplified.  Why not use that money to subsidize public transit like the Go Pass for more members of the Stanford community and then eliminate the confusion of the commute cash? /  / 2) Better timed Marguerite shuttles for Caltrain connection.  It would not be hard to adjust the X, Y, and P Marguerite lines so that the depart Palo Alto Caltrain station after Caltrains arrive rather that just minutes before.  It is extremely frustrating when connections do not match because a train is merely 2 minutes late, or when there is no shuttle scheduled to depart for 20+ minutes.  Since Bay Area transit is so fragmented among so many different systems (BART, Caltrain, VTA, MUNI, etc. etc.), any help in making connections easier would greatly benefit commuters.

R_9GNqgVSOWZy9ZLD,"I appreciate these surveys, but they aren't geared toward 'mega-commuters.' I travel about 180 miles (30 - 40 hours per week) round trip and luckily I can commute with people to Cupertino most days, but that will change in 2015. I think individual departments should distribute and respond to this survey to counsel employees who may have complicated commutes directly. This is about the third survey I've taken and I don't hear the survey results and never seem to be notified if any changes are implemented as a result of respondent feedback. I also don't think carpool credit applies since I split from my carpool partners (my kids going to DeAnza college) and they park on their campus. I might be going back to commuter club since it's cheaper for them to park on their campus than it is for me. Also the gas credit doesn't work because I travel so far. I stopped uploading my receipts because one trip uses them up and it's not worth trying to remember when I can upload a new gas receipt when I fill up 2-3 times per week depending if I'm working on Saturday. I hope you don't see this as complaining, I just want to be sure that you have feedback beyond the information you are looking to gather.

R_5mDgpiLISbBEEux,"I am very dissatisfied with the parking on campus. It is very expensive, even for residents who have families. I understand that if you're singly you might not need a car. But if you have a family with young kids, not having a car is not really an option since it's impractical to carry car seats to the zip cars every time you want to use them. Furthermore, not only are we charged a lot to park (and ticketed if we or our friends don't use the passes), during the busiest times the parking lots remain unenforced. For example, during football games, spectators park in our lots and make it very hard for us to find a spot. Additionally, there was recently an event at a Parent Coop (the one by Stanford Credit Union just off of Serra), where resident parking was explicitly given to the event. There were literally dozens of cars circling around my street and I couldn't go to the store because there wouldn't have been any spots when I got back. I don't understand why I pay for my parking spot, but then other organizations are explicitly given access to my parking spot (for free) when it's convenient for them. If I pay for a spot there better be a spot for me to park. I would understand a little more if we even got a few free scratchers for our friends. But I have no clue why a Stanford event should be allowed to take my parking space for free when my friends or I would get a ticket for doing the same thing.  / I love Stanford, but I don't like the parking and transportation services. We are treated like garbage and then we get these emails asking us for favors (such as not leaving or coming to campus during peak hours). Why would I care if Stanford is charged money by the city (for excessive peak hour traffic) if they're charging me tons of money for services that they are giving away to others for free? I even got a traffic ticket this year, which lost on appeal, when I had paid for my permit! I had not yet received it, but I did have the approved receipt in the window (which according to the receipt was a valid method of parking there). Stanford parking and transportation services treats me like garbage and I (and most other people I know) will make no effort to reduce traffic or make your jobs easier until you stop either not charging us for parking or at the very least not give the parking that we paid for away for free.

R_0dHwnyzzT3rrb1j,Overall the Uline service has improved over the past year. There is still a disconnect between a missing U line bus and this being communicated to riders.  This is especially impactful when it is the last bus of the day that is a no show because I have to have my husband come out and pick me up. I feel that Uline should be required to report all disabled buses to Stanford and there should be automatic Marguerite shuttle available when the uline is disabled. The Uline buses are getting old and starting to break down more. There was also a new Uline bus recently that has the minimal seating and a lot of standing that I would consider a great disservice if half of the buss had to stand all of the time.  Also the cross walk on Fremont Blvd on the East bound route is dangerous. It is not at a typical intersection and so people don't pay attention to people crossing the street. It would be helpful if Stanford could engage Fremont to put flashing lights across the cross walk to bring attention to the pedestrian traffic there.

R_6PwChhJTfpuQtGR,"Driving commutes have gotten dramatically worse in the 18 months I have been at Stanford, likely due at least in part to increased employment in the region. I try to do public transit at least one day per week (BART to Caltrain), but it takes 2 hours or more each way, and I often can't even get work done because of the need to stand on the train. Carpools and vanpools are too inflexible because I often have work situations that don't allow me to leave work at a regular time each day. What I REALLY would find useful is an express bus (like the Ardenwood Express) from the upper East Bay (I am in Alameda) that perhaps went twice a day in each direction - an early option and a late option. I could get work done on a large bus, and I would be able to get a later bus if I missed the early one. Please investigate the large number of Stanford people who I believe are commuting from the upper East Bay - Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, Albany. I have met dozens of them just in my own travels around campus. With the cost of housing in the Silicon Valley so prohibitive and no housing assistance programs available to staff, it really is necessary to have some transit alternatives that go beyond BART to Dumbarton Express/Line U/Caltrain, given the large amount of time those routes require.

I live 3 miles away from my work station on the main campus, but because there are no efficient transit routes between home and work, I am driving alone more often. The mismatch in times between Marguerite's arrival at Caltrain and Caltrain's departure, and the fact that I can only take trains that stop at every stop since I live by the next stop (Menlo Park), combine to make what should be a short commute much more lengthy.

The Margarite runs on week days with non-student friendly hours. I cannot use the Margarite to get home after 9 pm.  Because I run hours twice a week until 10 pm, the Margarite is often unhelpful.

It takes me 20 minutes to walk from the nearest Marguerite stop I can find on campus to get to my work place at IRISS (which is by the gold course). This is good when there is time but it's a shame that there is no closer stop. Bus stop numbers may make it a bit easier for people new to campus to understand the routes. As a visiting scholar who is staying about 30 minutes away I have found that this is all pretty complex and there is no quick learning curve. The Caltrain service at San Antonio is surprisingly restricted - there are surprisingly few suitable trains outside rush hour given that there is such a large population! The Marguerite buses to/from San Antonio area are not at suitable times for commuting to campus. It has been very hard for me to find a second hand bike that suits my height (tall woman - I have so far looked at four that are too small) and the bike shop on campus was unable serve me when I walked there at lunchtime (a 30 minute round trip) owing to a queue of people wanting repairs. My most remarkable experience was when I went to the Palo Alta bike shop and asked to be measured for a bike - they told me it would cost $350 to sit on their measuring machine.

R_74zOYGDUtsHARp3,"We asked for over a year for a bus route from the East Bay that would arrive in time for the employees that begin at 6AM and after doing our own legwork and circulating a petition we finally got a Marguerite shuttle. / Since then it has felt like Stanford is discouraging interest in this shuttle and hoping it will fail.  The shuttle has gotten smaller and smaller and the current shuttle is noisy, uncomfortable, and almost standing room only.  The published pickup time from the East Bay was changed from 5:20 to 5:15 even though the ACTUAL pick-up time is unchanged so now instead of the bus arriving at 5:15 and departing for Stanford at 5:20 the bus now arrives at 5:20 and leaves almost immediately.

Yesterday i forgot my phone and needed to call my husband on the way home so i wanted to Skype him with my iPad, but the AE had no wi-fi.  At Ardenwood Park and Ride i was able to connect to him briefly while standing next to a DB going back to Stanford.  When the DB and DB1 arrived simultaneously to go to Union City Bart i ran from one to the other and neither had working wi-fi!  One showed that it was connected but it didn't work.  I finallly had to call him from a pay phone at BART.  But it's typical that one or more of the multiple buses i take to or from campus has wifi that doesn't work, and sometimes it's all of them.  And with the diddling with the bus schedules over the years and increasing traffic, my commute is about 15 minutes longer in the morning and a half an hour or more longer in the afternoon, often exceeding 2 hours.

R_4IV6a7F0c6W1HzT,"Caltrain is great however parking is starting to become an issue. At the San Carlos station there used to be plentiful street parking but due to construction/development street parking close to the station is getting more difficult.

I'll probably park further away and bike to the station however due to scheduling (dropping off my son at school) there are still time limitations with regards to how much earlier I can get to the station. I believe Stanford used to offer pretax Caltrain parking passes. I would say depending on how bad street parking gets and taking into consideration the cost of a Caltrain parking pass, that driving into work might become a reality. My second comment is that there seems to be some inconsistency in when the Palm Drive departs the station in the morning. Some drivers wait for passengers while some pull away from the stop even with passengers close-by and clearly in view. From what I understand the P leaves on the tens. If this schedule is stuck to then that's fine however many times I've arrived on a train that pulls in at 8:23 (or somewhere in between the tens) and the P is still at the stop (I take a peek when the train is pulling in to see if the P is at the stop so I know if I should run), then only after passengers depart and we are walking toward the P does the driver leave (well past 8:20 and too early for the 8:30 departure).

I hope that there will soon be more parking on the Med School side of things so that Parking Structure 1 will not be so over-used.   (2)  Also about parking:  in our structure, there is no way to tell whether the upper levels are full.  If I have to drive at mid-day and can't use carpool spots (or if these are already gone, see comment (1)), I waste time and gas trying to drive to the upper levels only to find that there are no spots available.   Dozens of other cars will be circulating, producing exhaust and using gasoline, all trying to find a spot.

I won't help out in their classrooms in the morning b/c I won't be able to park.  The early-rising hospital employees get most of the parking spots!

Plus, I would drive to the Embarcadero site, then get on the TECH line, get off and Caltrain, and then get on the X line and repeat the whole process again in the evening.  I have an child care but after the route change, I would be regularly late and would be charged additional for child care. I think it's impractical to use transit if you live 15 - 20 mins away by car but it takes you upwards of an hour (many time hour and half) to get home. Therefore, I had to switch to driving again.

Talking about parking permits or gas prices as disincentives to driving wholly misinterprets the reason(s) people drive to work - nobody commutes for fun; they do it because they have to. Really, what Stanford should be doing is leveraging its position as a well-funded and well-respected institution to initiate public transit projects up and down the peninsula, because they are vastly under-resourced and more and more people are expressing a preference NOT to drive (and to live in urban areas).

R_3juOmCHr6oou4eN,"I used to take Caltrain from San Francisco and then Margeurite to campus. I now work off campus at 1070 Arastradero, and no longer take public transportation because the margeurite shuttle that runs between Caltrain and 1070 does not run as frequently - so if the train is late then I wait for another 30 minutes for the next shuttle to come.  Also because the shuttle makes more stops along this route it takes ~30 minutes.  So the trade off is to build in an extra 2 hrs round trip to my commute each day -- which isn't worth it for me. So it tends to be much faster and more consistent for me to drive each way. / If there were a dedicated 1070/1050 arastradero shuttle that picked up from Caltrain after each train I would use it! : ) / I miss taking the train! : (",10/14/13,,Marguerite,,,,,,,,,

For my commute, I usually drive alone mainly because of my child's transportation, but sometimes take VTA (or walk) - Caltrain - Marguerite (or walk). Each ride is very short, but using three different modules in one commute takes 2-3 times as long as driving because these transits don't have enough services and the connection is very inconvenient. I am a big fan of public transportation, so if these transit companies provide more services in commuting hours, and coordinate each other to provide more passenger-friendly connection and schedules, I would definitely use them more often. Also, I wish that the University would encourage telecommute more. A lot of work could be done at home as long as we have a computer and internet access.

More weekend service would also be appreciated (there's really no way of getting from many parts of campus to the Caltrain station, except the Shopping Express which takes time and comes infrequently). /  / There also needs to be a lot more bicycle parking on campus - most buildings have a few spots around them, but not enough to cover the rated capacity of the building. As a result, people have to park far from their classes or work. Many elect instead to leave their bikes locked only to themselves, often resulting in a mass of bikes in front of doors, creating a safety hazard. Others choose to lock their bikes to railings for safety, resulting in warnings or citations. Since this problem arises from lack of bicycle parking, I would strongly urge P&TS to install more bicycle racks near buildings (including considering bike lockers, hanging racks, and multi-storey racks, like those found at the shopping center, to increase bicycle parking density. There appears to be a lot of thought given to car parking, presumably mostly due to county regulations, but not all that much thought given to bike parking, despite Stanford saying how bike-friendly this campus is.",10/14/13,Bike,Marguerite,,,Parking,,,,,,

R_djnuDjTUvPlJs21,"I usually bike, walk, or take the Marguerite to campus. Every once in a while, when I know I will have to stay on campus very late to use a shared research tool or for some other reason, I stay at my home until around 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM and then drive my car to campus and park in visitor parking or C parking using a scratch permit. It makes me feel safer to drive home at 1:00 AM than it does to walk or bike at this time, especially given that there have been some robberies on Palm Drive and elsewhere on campus. However, it is usually extraordinarily difficult to park on campus during this time. I understand that it is good to minimize driving to campus as much as possible, but in certain situations like this I feel that driving is the best option for my personal safety. I think it would be helpful to consider strategies for making it easier to park on campus in these situations. For example, consider demand responsive pricing at the visitor pay parking stations (i.e. increase/decrease prices throughout the day so there is always on average one spot free at all times). Better yet, it seems that there are usually some parking spaces free on the top floor of Parking Structure 1 near my building, but these are A permit spaces. Maybe some of these spaces should be converted to additional visitor pay parking or C permit spaces. Having any unused parking spaces seems like a tremendous waste. Sometimes I have to drive around for up to 20 minutes to find a parking space, which is bad for the environment, bad for traffic on campus, and a waste of my time.",10/14/13,,,,,Parking,,,,,,

R_6KehrhEH2MVLxQ1,"1) Graduate students should be eligible for Go Pass.  This would increase public transportation usage while financially assisting a more needy Stanford group.  Grad students make roughly $25,000/year through stipend support, and yet are not eligible for a subsidized Go Pass; employees make considerably more, but are eligible.  There needs to be better support for graduate student commuters.  Bike maintenance programs, commute club, clean air cash, updates from P&TS are not significant; real support should come in dollars spent on subsidizing actual commute passes for those that need it.  Otherwise, why not just drive if you can? /  / 3) The Commute Cash ordering system is very confusing.  Commuters do not remember when they ordered, what months the listed on their order, when they need to re-order, etc..  This process could be streamlined and simplified.  Why not use that money to subsidize public transit like the Go Pass for more members of the Stanford community and then eliminate the confusion of the commute cash? /  / 2) Better timed Marguerite shuttles for Caltrain connection.  It would not be hard to adjust the X, Y, and P Marguerite lines so that the depart Palo Alto Caltrain station after Caltrains arrive rather that just minutes before.  It is extremely frustrating when connections do not match because a train is merely 2 minutes late, or when there is no shuttle scheduled to depart for 20+ minutes.  Since Bay Area transit is so fragmented among so many different systems (BART, Caltrain, VTA, MUNI, etc. etc.), any help in making connections easier would greatly benefit commuters.

R_9GNqgVSOWZy9ZLD,"I appreciate these surveys, but they aren't geared toward 'mega-commuters.' I travel about 180 miles (30 - 40 hours per week) round trip and luckily I can commute with people to Cupertino most days, but that will change in 2015. I think individual departments should distribute and respond to this survey to counsel employees who may have complicated commutes directly. This is about the third survey I've taken and I don't hear the survey results and never seem to be notified if any changes are implemented as a result of respondent feedback. I also don't think carpool credit applies since I split from my carpool partners (my kids going to DeAnza college) and they park on their campus. I might be going back to commuter club since it's cheaper for them to park on their campus than it is for me. Also the gas credit doesn't work because I travel so far. I stopped uploading my receipts because one trip uses them up and it's not worth trying to remember when I can upload a new gas receipt when I fill up 2-3 times per week depending if I'm working on Saturday. I hope you don't see this as complaining, I just want to be sure that you have feedback beyond the information you are looking to gather.

R_5mDgpiLISbBEEux,"I am very dissatisfied with the parking on campus. It is very expensive, even for residents who have families. I understand that if you're singly you might not need a car. But if you have a family with young kids, not having a car is not really an option since it's impractical to carry car seats to the zip cars every time you want to use them. Furthermore, not only are we charged a lot to park (and ticketed if we or our friends don't use the passes), during the busiest times the parking lots remain unenforced. For example, during football games, spectators park in our lots and make it very hard for us to find a spot. Additionally, there was recently an event at a Parent Coop (the one by Stanford Credit Union just off of Serra), where resident parking was explicitly given to the event. There were literally dozens of cars circling around my street and I couldn't go to the store because there wouldn't have been any spots when I got back. I don't understand why I pay for my parking spot, but then other organizations are explicitly given access to my parking spot (for free) when it's convenient for them. If I pay for a spot there better be a spot for me to park. I would understand a little more if we even got a few free scratchers for our friends. But I have no clue why a Stanford event should be allowed to take my parking space for free when my friends or I would get a ticket for doing the same thing.  / I love Stanford, but I don't like the parking and transportation services. We are treated like garbage and then we get these emails asking us for favors (such as not leaving or coming to campus during peak hours). Why would I care if Stanford is charged money by the city (for excessive peak hour traffic) if they're charging me tons of money for services that they are giving away to others for free? I even got a traffic ticket this year, which lost on appeal, when I had paid for my permit! I had not yet received it, but I did have the approved receipt in the window (which according to the receipt was a valid method of parking there). Stanford parking and transportation services treats me like garbage and I (and most other people I know) will make no effort to reduce traffic or make your jobs easier until you stop either not charging us for parking or at the very least not give the parking that we paid for away for free.

R_0dHwnyzzT3rrb1j,Overall the Uline service has improved over the past year. There is still a disconnect between a missing U line bus and this being communicated to riders.  This is especially impactful when it is the last bus of the day that is a no show because I have to have my husband come out and pick me up. I feel that Uline should be required to report all disabled buses to Stanford and there should be automatic Marguerite shuttle available when the uline is disabled. The Uline buses are getting old and starting to break down more. There was also a new Uline bus recently that has the minimal seating and a lot of standing that I would consider a great disservice if half of the buss had to stand all of the time.  Also the cross walk on Fremont Blvd on the East bound route is dangerous. It is not at a typical intersection and so people don't pay attention to people crossing the street. It would be helpful if Stanford could engage Fremont to put flashing lights across the cross walk to bring attention to the pedestrian traffic there.

R_6PwChhJTfpuQtGR,"Driving commutes have gotten dramatically worse in the 18 months I have been at Stanford, likely due at least in part to increased employment in the region. I try to do public transit at least one day per week (BART to Caltrain), but it takes 2 hours or more each way, and I often can't even get work done because of the need to stand on the train. Carpools and vanpools are too inflexible because I often have work situations that don't allow me to leave work at a regular time each day. What I REALLY would find useful is an express bus (like the Ardenwood Express) from the upper East Bay (I am in Alameda) that perhaps went twice a day in each direction - an early option and a late option. I could get work done on a large bus, and I would be able to get a later bus if I missed the early one. Please investigate the large number of Stanford people who I believe are commuting from the upper East Bay - Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, Albany. I have met dozens of them just in my own travels around campus. With the cost of housing in the Silicon Valley so prohibitive and no housing assistance programs available to staff, it really is necessary to have some transit alternatives that go beyond BART to Dumbarton Express/Line U/Caltrain, given the large amount of time those routes require.

I live 3 miles away from my work station on the main campus, but because there are no efficient transit routes between home and work, I am driving alone more often. The mismatch in times between Marguerite's arrival at Caltrain and Caltrain's departure, and the fact that I can only take trains that stop at every stop since I live by the next stop (Menlo Park), combine to make what should be a short commute much more lengthy.

The Margarite runs on week days with non-student friendly hours. I cannot use the Margarite to get home after 9 pm.  Because I run hours twice a week until 10 pm, the Margarite is often unhelpful.

It takes me 20 minutes to walk from the nearest Marguerite stop I can find on campus to get to my work place at IRISS (which is by the gold course). This is good when there is time but it's a shame that there is no closer stop. Bus stop numbers may make it a bit easier for people new to campus to understand the routes. As a visiting scholar who is staying about 30 minutes away I have found that this is all pretty complex and there is no quick learning curve. The Caltrain service at San Antonio is surprisingly restricted - there are surprisingly few suitable trains outside rush hour given that there is such a large population! The Marguerite buses to/from San Antonio area are not at suitable times for commuting to campus. It has been very hard for me to find a second hand bike that suits my height (tall woman - I have so far looked at four that are too small) and the bike shop on campus was unable serve me when I walked there at lunchtime (a 30 minute round trip) owing to a queue of people wanting repairs. My most remarkable experience was when I went to the Palo Alta bike shop and asked to be measured for a bike - they told me it would cost $350 to sit on their measuring machine.
